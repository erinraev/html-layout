        <p>Originally bred to herd cattle, sheep, and horses, the Pembroke Welsh
          Corgi is an active and intelligentÂ dog breed. Easy to train and eager to
          learn, Pembrokes are great with children and other pets, and you can
          find them in four different coat colors and markings. They are the best
           dogs ever besides being stubborn assholes. </p>
